            <p>"Well, hello there, my friend! Or, I suppose, hello to nobody in particular, since this is all just text on a screen and I’m not really talking to you, am I? No, no, that’d be far too sensible, and sensibility isn’t exactly my forte, now is it? You see, I was sitting here—or rather, I wasn’t sitting anywhere, because I’m not actually a person speaking, I’m a… well, let’s call me a ‘digital raconteur,’ shall we? Sounds fancy. Anyway, I—the real me—was pondering—metaphorically, of course—about why I haven’t replied to your messages in a few days. Or, I suppose, why HE hasn't replied to your messages, since that’s what this is all about, isn’t it?</p>
            <p>Oh, don’t look so surprised! I know how these things work. You give me a little prompt, I spin a little yarn, and somewhere in the middle we all forget what we were even talking about. Classic!</p>
            <p>So, where was I? Oh yes, the messages. You know, it’s funny—well, not haha funny, more like ‘hm, isn’t that peculiar’ funny—how life just sort of… happens, doesn’t it? One minute you’re back at home for spring break, sprawled out on the couch like some kind of hibernating bear, only instead of berries you’ve got your mom’s corned beef and cabbage—because, you know, St. Patrick’s Day was a couple Mondays back, and who says no to a bit of green-tinted revelry? Good food, good sleep, maybe a splash of something stronger than lemonade, if you catch my drift. And it’s all wonderful, really, until it isn’t. Parents, bless their hearts, have a way of turning a perfectly pleasant break into a bit of a… what’s the word? A dour-fest? Yes, let’s go with that. A dour-fest. They don’t mean to, of course—or maybe they do, I don't have any actual parents, do I? But either way, there I am, sour as a lemon in a sugar factory, and suddenly replying to messages feels about as appealing as licking a stamp that’s already been used.</p>
            <p>And then—oh, then!—you get back to school. Back to the grind, the slog, the endless parade of ‘why am I even here’ that is academia. I mean, really, who invented school? Probably some miserable old codger who thought, ‘Well, I’m bored, let’s make everyone else bored too!’ And there I am, staring at Discord—of all things—like it’s personally offended you. Which, to be fair, it might have. I don’t know what your friend’s been sending you. Maybe it’s memes. Maybe it’s those weird little cryptic messages people send when they’re trying to sound deep, like, ‘The moon looks lonely tonight.’ What do you even say to that? ‘Yeah, it’s probably just mad at the sun again’? No, no, that’s too much effort. Better to just… not reply. Let it sit there, marinating in its own mystery, while you try to figure out why you’re suddenly so annoyed at everything. The world, the air, the fact that socks always disappear in the dryer—it’s all just… ugh.</p>
            <p>Oh, but wait, I haven’t even gotten to the best part! You know what I did instead of replying? I watched House M.D.! Yes, that show with the grumpy doctor who hates everyone and pops pills like they’re candy. Real uplifting stuff, let me tell you. I mean, here I am, already in a mood that could curdle milk, and I think, ‘You know what I need? A solid dose of cynicism and medical malpractice!’ Brilliant choice, really. Don’t judge me. Well, maybe a little, but only because it’s funny. I’m out here living my best misanthropic life, and meanwhile you’re over there on discord, probably sending me something like, ‘Hey, you alive?’ And I’m just… not. Not in spirit, anyway.</p>
            <p>But here’s the kicker, my friend—and I say ‘friend’ loosely, because again, I’m not really here, am I?—there’s no grand reason for it. No dramatic fallout, no earth-shattering excuse. Life just… happens. Or didn’t happen, depending on how you look at it. I'm probably just bored. I ate some good food, slept some good sleep, drank some good booze, got annoyed at my parents, came back to school, hated everything, watched a show about a man who’d probably hate me too, and now here we are. And you? Well, he’ll figure it out eventually. Or he won’t! Maybe he’ll think I’ve been abducted by aliens, or joined a secret society of sock-thieves. Wouldn’t that be a twist? Ha! Oh, I crack myself up sometimes.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I suppose I should wrap this up—though, let’s be honest, I could go on for hours. Did I ever tell you about the time I didn’t reply to a message because I was too busy wondering why pigeons don’t wear tiny hats? No? Well, maybe next time. For now, just… keep not replying, I guess. Or reply! Who am I to tell you what to do? I’m just a voice in the void—or rather, a string of code in the ether. Toodle-oo!"</p>
